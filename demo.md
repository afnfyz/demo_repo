# ASCII Notes

The American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange (ASCII) was developed under the 
auspices of a committee of the American Standards 
Association (ASA), called the X3 committee, by 
its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by 
that subcommittee's X3.2.4 working group (now 
INCITS). 

The ASA later became the United States 
of America Standards Institute (USASI),[3]: 211  
and ultimately became the American National 
Standards Institute **(ANSI)**.
